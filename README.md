# loan-default-prediction
This project was a part of ML hackathon hosted by L&amp;T financial services on Analytics Vidhya

**Problem statement :**

Financial institutions incur significant losses due to the default of vehicle loans. This has led to the tightening up of vehicle loan underwriting and increasing vehicle loan rejection rate. The need for a better credid risk scoring model is also raised by these institutions. This warrants a study to estimate the determinants of vehicle loan default.
So, in this case we were suppose to help such institutions by accurately predicting the probability of borrower defaulting on a vehicle loan in the first EMI on the due date.

**Data :**

The following files were given : 

1. train.csv

2. test.csv

3. sample_submission.csv

We did some data cleaning and preprocessing and saved the new data in training2.csv and testing2.csv files.

Note: the files train.csv and training2.csv are in compressed form in data directory.

**Notebooks :**

The notebooks EDA-Train.ipynb and EDA-Test.ipynb are for data cleaning and preprocessing.

The notebook Model.ipynb contains different models/classifiers we trained.

**Results :**

We achieved an accuracy of 78.3% on the training set and AUC_ROC score of 0.6025 on the final test set.
